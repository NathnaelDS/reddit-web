# Reddit, but smaller - frontend

I worked through Ben Awad's [Fullstack React GraphQL TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8)

This is my frontend for the application. The code for my backend can be found [here](https://github.com/NathnaelDS/reddit-server).

These were the things covered in the tutorial, but I learned **a lot** more as I researched while building this app.
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- URQL/Apollo
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- MikroORM/TypeORM
- Redis
- Next.js
- TypeGraphQL
- Chakra
